# Dawn Staley Google Doodle

The USA Basketball Women’s National team is a legendary basketball dynasty, having won 7 consecutive Olympic gold medals. The dynasty begins and ends, for the time being, with Dawn Staley. Staley won 3 of those medals as a player, two as an assistant coach, and one as head coach. She didn’t lose a single game in her 5 year head coaching tenure.

Dawn has also dominated the NCAA in all positions. As a player at the University of Virginia, she led her team to four NCAA Tournaments, three Final Fours and one National Championship game. She began head coaching at Temple University while still playing professionally, a rare feat. In 2008 she accepted a position at the University of South Carolina and built an elite program from the ground up, going on to win National Championships in 2017 and 2022.

Staley has said that her mentality as a college coach is to prepare players to become pros. She has done just that, mentoring the likes of WNBA champion Candice Dupree, Olympic champions A’ja Wilson and Allisha Gray, and young standouts like Aliyah Boston, Zia Cooke, and Brea Beal.
