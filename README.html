        The USA Basketball Women’s National team is a legendary basketball
        dynasty, having won 7 consecutive Olympic gold medals. The dynasty
        begins and ends, for the time being, with Dawn Staley. Staley won 3 of
        those medals as a player, two as an assistant coach, and one as head
        coach. She didn’t lose a single game in her 5 year head coaching tenure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dawn has also dominated the NCAA in all positions. As a player at the
        University of Virginia, she led her team to four NCAA Tournaments, three
        Final Fours and one National Championship game. She began head coaching
        at Temple University while still playing professionally, a rare feat. In
        2008 she accepted a position at the University of South Carolina and
        built an elite program from the ground up, going on to win National
        Championships in 2017 and 2022.

        Staley has said that her mentality as a college coach is to prepare
        players to become pros. She has done just that, mentoring the likes of
        WNBA champion Candice Dupree, Olympic champions A’ja Wilson and Allisha
        Gray, and future greats Destanni Henderson and Aliyah Boston.
